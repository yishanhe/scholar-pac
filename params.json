An example is like below:\r\n\r\n    Host tunnel-name\r\n        HostName xxxxxxxxx\r\n        Port 22\r\n        DynamicForward localhost:1080\r\n        ExitOnForwardFailure yes\r\n        TCPKeepAlive yes\r\n        Compression yes\r\n        CompressionLevel 9\r\n        ServerAliveInterval 60\r\n        ServerAliveCountMax 60\r\n        User yourusername\r\n\r\nThose options are at your decisions.\r\n\r\n## Setup Chrome\r\nThere are many options to explore on different operating systems and browsers for proxying. I will give an example on Chrome.\r\n\r\nInstall [SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en)\r\n\r\nDelete those default profiles. Add a new profile and select PAC file, import the PAC file in this repository.\r\nUsing a url of this file also works: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yishanhe/scholar-pac/master/scholar.pac](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yishanhe/scholar-pac/master/scholar.pac).\r\nName this profile and save it.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nFirst, start your tunnel `ssh -l -N tunnel-name` (You can use an alias if you find inputing `ssh -l -N` annoying.)\r\nThis will run in background.\r\nIn case, you can find this process and kill it by `px aux | grep tunnel-name` to get its pid xxxxxx and `kill xxxxxx`.\r\n\r\nAfter turninig on your SwitchyOmega to the profile you previously set, it is all set.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.\r\n\r\nTry google `my ip` to test or just go to IEEE explorer to test.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes, you need to refresh the targeted page several times such that you can see \"purchase\"->\"download\".\r\n- Sometimes, the ssh link may not be stable on celluar tethering. Better turn on compression.\r\n\r\n## Accepting Pull Request to updaing the PAC file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
